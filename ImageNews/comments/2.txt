	"commentText": ["I read the whole book. The size might be intimading but it is not a hard read.", "I don´t need to make a summary because you can find plenty on the Internet, including here. However, he barely addresses CRONY CAPITALISM, a disease in Brazil and rampant in the US. In the case of Brazil, a country he never mentions in his book (because they couldn´t get data, what a surprise...), I believe crony capitalism plays a huge role in explaining the historical inequality in the country. For example, since 51% (official data btw) of the credit is given by the government via public banks, so the friends of the king can get credit at the best rate possible (Eike Batista, for example). And those friends are already wealthy men with political connection so people with no connections in the government cannot get the same benefits. It has been the case for decades.", "Sure, I don´t agree with some of his arguments, and as I mentioned, he never really addresses crony capitalism. Moreover, he never really said who were the 50 richest families in the US (for example) a century or 50 years ago and today so we could compare, but I still think is a great read. Lots of data, I just wish Mr Piketty were able to get more data for countries Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, India but I understand it was not easy."],

	"commentText": ["In a state of perfect competition, all profits are competed away. And you're right to say that businessmen seek ways to warp the market to their advantage to achieve a profit. One of the easiest ways to do this is to enlist the help of governments to grant them a monopoly outright or draft regulations which favor incumbents. Oftentimes these methods will not create benefits for consumers that outweigh their costs. But it's notable that they're a product of government intervention into a free market rather than a feature of it. And it's hard to imagine an alternative economic system that could avoid government meddling in the production or distribution of goods and services in response to the special pleading of interest groups and/or opportunities for graft.", "But companies can also create temporary profitable niches through socially beneficial means - principally product or process innovation or specialization. And I see a lot of evidence, as I'm sure you do too, that profit-seeking companies are creating consumer benefit for their customers rather than victimizing them.", "And while capitalists may bemoan their businesses being upended by creative destruction, they also participate in the marketplace as consumers and thereby benefit from that same creative destruction. And if they manage save some of their earnings, they might also benefit from producers' profits by investing in those same companies. All things considered, capitalism delivers a better standard of living than the available alternatives."],

	"commentText": ["he most alarming factor for divergence, i think is the rapidly decreasing jobs to technology. The past decade has seen a gradual, but very real decrease of the average marginal return to labor, which essentially means that growth is going on fine without the help of human labor. With 3d printing of buildings and automatic cars, and major advances in artificial intelligence, we are rapidly moving towards a situation where a fully self-sustained economy is possible without the help of human labor, or a very minimal use for it. This is the reason why the executive payrolls have become so high, now they can afford it, since there is far less amount of people. This. coupled with other strong factors for divergence, will surely overpower the forces pushing in the other direction, for convergence. This also means that only welfare economies can exist in the future, since with the lack of jobs, the corporations cannot work in an impoverished society. Such a situation with inevitably lead to major political rebellion. There is a Harvard study which said that 50 percent of all employment can be more efficiently taken over by machines in the next ten years. This means we must either force the corporations to employ people instead of machines, which may greatly reduce inefficiency. Also many corporations find a way out this by lowering the salaries."],
